# D3 Hoops Frontend

Still working on names.

[Gatsby starter repo](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default)

To Do:
- Figure out how to put tables in the pages. Can I use GraphQL for that or do I need to do that separately?
- Pull in results from view instead of table to then get rudimentary team / season pages for what's in the db
- Make a Table template, a la Layout?
  - Maybe the `react-table` package?
